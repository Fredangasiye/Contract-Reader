This policy is underwritten by Hollard Specialist Insurance Limited, a Licensed \nNon-Life Insurer and an authorised Financial Services Provider.\n \n5 \n\n \nImportant info  \nItem selfie  \nYou must submit an item inspection (\"selfie\") using the Naked Insurance app, \nincluding photos or videos and any requested details to confirm that the item exists \nand is in good condition. Keep in mind that proof of value and ownership, like \nvaluation certificates, invoices, and receipts, will still be required in the event of a \nclaim. \nYou must submit a selfie promptly after your cover starts. \n● We use the selfie to verify the condition and existence of your item at the \nstart of your cover and to determine if we can insure it. \n● Without the selfie, we may be unable to approve your claim, as we can't \nconfirm the item's condition or existence at the start of your cover. In this \ncase, we may void your cover and refund your premiums, meaning it will be \nas if your item was never insured. \n \nCooling-off rights \nIf you want to cancel cover in the first 31 days and you want it backdated to when \nyou started we will gladly refund you the full premium, but only if you havenʼt \nclaimed. \n \n \nYour cover       \nThe items we cover \nThis cover is for a single, specified item (for which you choose a value when you \nbuy the cover, and of which you provide details and/or pictures when you do the \nitem selfie). \nNaked Financial Technology Pty Ltd is an authorised Financial Services Provider (FSP 48822). This policy is underwritten by Hollard Specialist Insurance Limited, a Licensed \nNon-Life Insurer and an authorised Financial Services Provider.\n \n6 \n\n \nYou can only insure an item in one of the specific categories on the app. If, as part \nof the review of the item selfie, we decide that we cannot cover the item, we will \ncancel your cover back to the cover start date and we will pay back all the premium \nwe received. This means it is as if we never insured that item (voiding cover). \nThe following specific items may not be insured under this policy: \n● Firearms and guns; \n● \nCollectibles\n (any item that is regarded as being of value or interest to a \ncollector, for example stamps, coins and medal collections). \nCollectibles also \ninclude items such as limited edition or rare items that are collected for their \nanticipated increase in value over time; \n● Cash, Krugerrands or similar coins; \n● Motorised equipment, such as golf carts, childrenʼs motorised \nscooters/motorbikes or Segways. This exclusion does not apply to e-bikes, \nwhich may be insured under this policy; \n● Caravans, trailers and their permanent fittings, which must be insured under \na separate caravan/trailer policy; or \n● Drones. \n \nHow we cover you \n● We will cover the single specified item listed in your policy summary against \naccidental loss or damage that is not specifically excluded by this policy. \n● We will cover the single specified item within the borders of South Africa. We \nwill also cover the single specified item for a maximum of six months per \n12-month period of insurance while you are travelling anywhere in the world. \n \nCover conditions \nYou must submit an item inspection (called an “item selfieˮ or “selfieˮ) of the item \nyou want to insure, by using the Naked Insurance app. This means taking pictures \nor videos of the item plus supplying us with any supporting information that we ask \nNaked Financial Technology Pty Ltd is an authorised Financial Services Provider (FSP 48822). This policy is underwritten by Hollard Specialist Insurance Limited, a Licensed \nNon-Life Insurer and an authorised Financial Services Provider.\n \n7 \n\n \nfor, in order to confirm to us that the item exists and is in good condition. Remember \nthat you must still submit proof of value and ownership in the event of a claim, so it \nis important to keep valuation certificates, invoices and receipts of the single item \nyou want to insure. \n● You must submit a selfie as soon as possible, but not later than seven 7 \ndays after your cover start date. \n● You do not have cover for accidental damage before you have submitted \nyour selfie. We will cover you for loss or other damage during the seven 7 \ndays, subject to proof of value and proof of ownership, even if you havenʼt \nyet submitted the selfie. \n● We use the selfie to assess whether we can continue to cover your single \nitem after this period. \n● We will cancel your cover for the single item back to the cover start date and \npay back all the premium we received for the item in the following instances \nbelow. This means it is as if we never insured the item (voiding cover). \n○ You do not submit the selfie within the seven 7 days. \n○ You submit the selfie, but we decide not to cover the item based on \nthe detail received in the selfie. \n \nHow much cover do you have? \n● The single item is only covered for how much it would cost to replace the \nitem based on its specifications, make and model (where applicable). You \nmust give us all the information we need as part of the item selfie, such as \nthe serial number, value of the item and a description. \n● We may decide whether we will repair the item, replace the item, or pay you \nin the form of cash or a voucher from a suitable provider of our choice. \nShould we choose to replace your item, we will only replace it with the same \nmodel, or if we are unable to source the exact same model, a similar model \navailable. If your item is over insured, there is no option to upgrade your \nitem. \n● This is why it is important to insure your item for its latest replacement value. \nIf we are able to source a replacement device, the maximum amount that we \nNaked Financial Technology Pty Ltd is an authorised Financial Services Provider (FSP 48822). This policy is underwritten by Hollard Specialist Insurance Limited, a Licensed \nNon-Life Insurer and an authorised Financial Services Provider.\n \n8 \n\n \nwill pay out will be the cost of that replacement device. If we are unable to \nsource a replacement device, the amount of a claim will never be more than \nthe value which you insured it for, as shown on the app and the policy \nsummary. \n● You must insure your item for its latest replacement value. Update the value \nof your insured item regularly by taking into account that the value of cell \nphones and electronic items reduces over time as technology improves, \nwhile other itemsʼ value may increase. \n \nExclusions What are you not covered for? \n● Loss or damage to the operating system and software of electronic devices \nlike cell phones, tablets, laptops, desktop computers, media servers and \nhandheld electronic devices. \n● Cyber incidents: We do not cover any kind of loss or damage or costs which \nare directly caused by a cyber incident.

We will not pay for any loss you may \nsuffer because you were not able to make a phone call during that time. \n● Items covered under a guarantee: Any item that is covered against an \ninsured event by any guarantee, service contract, purchase contract or any \nagreement of any type. \n● Defective design, workmanship or materials: We do not cover any loss or \ndamage to an insured item because of defective design, workmanship or \nmaterials, including any expenses to correct a fault in the design or \nconstruction of the insured item. \n● Theft by false pretences or scams: We do not cover any loss or damage if \nyou are tricked by any means into parting with your insured property, such \nas through a scam or theft by false pretences \nNaked Financial Technology Pty Ltd is an authorised Financial Services Provider (FSP 48822).

This policy is underwritten by Hollard Specialist Insurance Limited, a Licensed \nNon-Life Insurer and an authorised Financial Services Provider.\n \n14 \n\n \nwas insufficient). \n● Photographs taken of the scene (if any were taken). \n● Proof of forcible entry to or exit from your home (where necessary). \n● The police reference number (case number). \n● The details of witnesses and any other persons that were involved in the \nincident (if applicable). \n● Details of any other insurance that covers the same item(s).

This policy is underwritten by Hollard Specialist Insurance Limited, a Licensed \nNon-Life Insurer and an authorised Financial Services Provider.\n \n15 \n\n \nWhat not to do when claiming \nIt is very important to comply and not do anything set out below, otherwise your \nclaim could be rejected: \n● Do not repair, replace or dispose of lost/damaged items, before getting our \npermission in writing. This does not apply to expenses to safeguard your \nhome contents up to the amount set out in the section on additional \nbenefits). \n● Do not admit guilt, fault, liability, or incur any legal costs without first getting \nour permission. \n● Do not offer or negotiate to pay a claim. \n● Do not accept any offer from another person for any damage that you want \nto claim for under this policy. If you do, you will not have any claim under this \npolicy. \n \nWhat you must pay \n● Your excess is the first amount that you must pay towards a claim under this \npolicy. \n● You may choose the excess for each individual item that you insure. The \nexcess is shown on the app under each itemʼs cover summary. \n● The excess that is applicable to your claim will be the excess selected on the \nNaked Insurance App at the time of the insured event.  \n● If more than one item is affected by a single event, you will have to pay the \nexcess applicable to each item. If the same event also results in loss or \ndamage under the Owners or Renters sections, you will have to pay the \napplicable excess per item plus the excess under the Owners or Renters \nsection. \n● If we settle a claim by making a payment to you, then we will deduct the \nexcess from the amount we pay. If we settle a claim in any other way, then \nyou must pay the excess directly to the service provider. \n \nNaked Financial Technology Pty Ltd is an authorised Financial Services Provider (FSP 48822). This policy is underwritten by Hollard Specialist Insurance Limited, a Licensed \nNon-Life Insurer and an authorised Financial Services Provider.\n \n16 \n\n \nWhat we pay \nWhen your claim has been approved, the maximum amount we will pay equals the \nlimit, less the excess amount. We will pay: \n● The cost of repairs or replacement up to a maximum of the limit; \n● Less the excess amount. \nWe may at our discretion repair, replace or pay you for the amount of damages. If \nappropriate, we may also use any combination of these methods. Our objective is to \nplace you in the same position as you were before the loss took place, subject to a \nmaximum of the limit chosen by you prior to the incident. \nIf we replace or repair, we are not required to do so exactly or precisely but only as \ncircumstances reasonably allow. \n● We will choose the supplier or repairer. \n● We may reuse existing materials. \n● If matching materials are not available, we are not required to create a \nuniform effect. \n● The standard of repair or replacement will meet but not exceed the \nrequirements of any manufacturer or applicable legislation. \n● At our discretion, we may decide not to replace or repair. We will then pay \nyou up to a maximum of the limit. \n● Remember, our responsibility ends after we have paid the claim. Once we \nhave paid a claim, we have met our responsibilities to you in terms of this \npolicy. We will not be responsible for any other costs relating to that claim. \n● We will also not pay any interest. So any amount due by us will not attract \nany interest. \n● If we repair or replace, we will pay the service provider directly. \n● If you have already done the repairs or replacement we will pay you back the \ncost that you have paid. We will only pay you the amount we would have \npaid if we had repaired or replaced the item ourselves.   \n \nNaked Financial Technology Pty Ltd is an authorised Financial Services Provider (FSP 48822). This policy is underwritten by Hollard Specialist Insurance Limited, a Licensed \nNon-Life Insurer and an authorised Financial Services Provider.\n \n17 \n\n \nWhen we will pay \nWe will pay a valid claim as soon as all documents have been received, we have \nassessed the claim as valid and you have paid your excess (if applicable). \n \nWhat happens if you have a claim on a pair or set \nof items? \nWe will not pay more than the proportionate value of any items that are part of a pair \nor a set. For example, if you lose one earring, we will pay out the value of only that \nearring. \n \nWhat happens if you have other insurance? \nIf you have more than one insurance policy in place that covers the same item, the \nway we deal with a claim will depend on whether the item is insured as a “specified \nitemˮ or an “unspecified itemˮ with the other insurer as explained below: \n● The item is insured as “unspecifiedˮ under the other policy: If the item is \ncovered as an “unspecifiedˮ item with another insurer, then you must claim \nfrom this policy and not from the other insurer because you pay a specific \npremium for it under this policy. \nFor example: Your watch is covered under this policy as a specified item and \nyou pay a specific premium for it. This means that you pay a premium that is \nbased on the make and value of your watch. If your watch is stolen, the \nother insurer will not pay for the watch under their policy. You must claim for \nthe watch from this policy. \n● The item is specified under the other policy: If an item insured under this \npolicy is also insured with another insurer as a specified item for which you \npay a specific premium to the other insurer, then the full amount of the claim \nwill be split proportionally between the two policies. Please refer to the Dual \ninsurance clause in the Naked Insurance Basics for a full explanation of how \nthis works. \n \nNaked Financial Technology Pty Ltd is an authorised Financial Services Provider (FSP 48822).
